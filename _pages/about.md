We are Civic Tech Toronto Polis group!

We believe that facilitating collective intelligence and fostering mutual understanding within communities is essential for our community. Polis is a good engagement tool for large-scale, open-ended feedback gathering.

We want to get more people know it.
We want to make it better tool for people.
We want to go beyond deliberation and make action items.
